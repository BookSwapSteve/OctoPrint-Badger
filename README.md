# OctoPrint-Badger

Prints 2D Badges/Labels.

Uses OctoPrint system to allow for "Do No Hack" labels to be printed on a Dymo Label Writer (for MakeSpace) using RFID tags.

Not really used for 3D printing unless you wish to modify and automate to print labels for when a print is finished or something.
